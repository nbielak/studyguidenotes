Graphs

 non-linear data structure

 collection of objects, nodes, connected by edges

 in graph no rules for connection between nodes

 tree = special kind of graph

 Graph: G = (V, E)
    g is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set of E of edges

    (a,b) != (b, a) (ordered pair)

Edge representation of two end points

directed: edge is connected one way
undirected: edge is connected two ways

Digraph: graph with all directed edges

Graphs can be used to represent many types of data
    social networks
        facebook: undirected graph
    world wide web
        digraph to represent links

graphs can be used for webcrawling tp get info websites
    graph traversal

weighted graph

some connections in graph more important than others  

associate cost/weight with edge
    edge labeled by weight
